#EYFS 
It is a dog.
It is a cat.
It is a red fox.
It is a big bus.
The hen is red.
The box is big.
The frog sat on the log.
The star is big.
The pigs can run fast.
The man is in a van.
He is sad.
He can go to the shop.
He can jump up.
He has ten bags.
She has six bees.
She is in bed.
She is sad.
She can run fast.
This is Mum and Dad.
I can go on the bus.
I am not in the car.
I had a jam bun.
I will go to the zoo.
This is my cat.
This is fun.
This is his Mum and Dad.
#KS1
It is not a big dog.
It is a big and black cat.
It is a very red and angry fox.
I like cars.
The bus is bigger than the van.
The rain was very wet.
The car is fast.
The ball is near the hole.
The fire kept them warm.
#Conjunctions
I like vans but they are too slow.
The bus is bigger but it is not faster.
He has a big car and she has a big bus.
The rain was wet but I had an umbrella.
A red spaceship landed in my little garden.
The alien landed so he could say hello.
#Other
Yesterday, I went swimming.
Today, my sister is starting preschool.
The little insects love the long grass.
A hairy monkey jumped on my cosy bed.
The car drove down the road.
Have you seen an alien?
What time shall we eat the cake?
Which piece of fruit would you like?
How old is your great grandad?
The heavy book was too big to carry.
The tiny ant crawled into my yummy sandwich.
Go and get some sweets from the shop.
The bear was hunting for food.
I put butter on my popcorn.
When did you sit on the cat?
Why are you wriggling around on your chair?
They wanted to eat the chocolate cake with yummy cream.
We knocked on the door three times.
She put the clothes into the dryer.
She will be four years old in October.
She has long and pretty hair.
She has hair with a fancy band.
Use the ladder to reach the toys but donâ€™t fall off.
She likes cats because they are cute.
He can jump high because he is tall.
It can roll because it is round.
Can I have a bite of your pear?
What is the time?
Do you have a watch so you can tell the time?
Can I pour you a glass of cold water?
Can we play outside in the rain?
How many apples can you eat?
The spider waited for flies in her web.
A square has four sides and four corners.
How many books are in the box?
The star was hanging on the Christmas tree.
Why are you crying so loudly?
Why did you crash the car into the wall?
He was very happy.
What a fast car!
What a huge bang!
Who made that horrible smell?
What a horrible smell!
